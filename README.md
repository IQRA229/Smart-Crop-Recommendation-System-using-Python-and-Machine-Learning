#  Smart Crop Recommendation System using Python and Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based system that recommends suitable crops based on soil parameters like pH, temperature, rainfall, and soil type.

## Problem Statement
Farmers often rely on traditional knowledge to select crops. This system helps by giving AI-based recommendations using soil data.

##  Objective
To develop a crop recommendation system using Decision Tree Classifier in Python.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
- IDE: VS Code
- Algorithm: DecisionTreeClassifier

##  Dataset
Sample dataset created with 8 records including:
- Soil Type (1=Loamy, 2=Sandy, 3=Clay)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Temperature (Â°C)
- pH
- Recommended Crop

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `main.py`
3. Enter the required values in the terminal
4. Get the recommended crop!

##  Future Improvements
- Add real-world dataset
- GUI using Tkinter or Web App with Flask
- Model accuracy improvement
